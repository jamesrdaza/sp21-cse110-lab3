                        After a long night of no sleep I woke up and realized I had not eaten anything the day before. I was <strong>hungry</strong> I hastily decided to go for a quick bike ride to get some chicken wings.
                        The more and more I pedaled the more tired I had gotten. About halfway through my chicken wing journey I was exhausted chalking it upto lack of excercise due to the 
                        pandemic. This was the most tired I've been biking around the UCSD hills even the employee noticed how winded I was and commented on it. It was then when I had some 
                        suspicions so I inspected my bike and realized there was a flat tire. In my hungry craze for wings I failed to notice that my front bike tire was flat. Then I had 2 choices
                        to either walk my bike or ride it on the way back. My hungry mind was flooded at the thought of eating those chicken wings so I decided to just bear it out and here I am today with
                        a broken front tire and can't bike until I get it fixed now.<br>

                        Things to do:
                            <li>Figure out what inner tube I have</li>
                            <li>Get new inner tube</li>
                            <li>Learn how to replace inner tube</li>

                        I have a match later today. It is currently playoffs and I am a bit nervous since these are the matches that matter the most. Honestly I don't feel like I've prepared well,
                        but I've been through this before. I'm hoping that my previous experiences will prevail and guide me through this. There is some money on the line if we can get far enough there
                        are some monetary prizes. I need to warm up, practice, and be confident to be able to do well. This doesn't exactly stop me being anxious though.<br>

                    <li>Warmup</li>
                    <li>Winout</li>
                </ol>

                        I need to take a quiz for one of my classes today. Honestly examinations for me are nerve wracking. I feel like they always get the better of me. I need to learn how to not
                        be as stressed as I am. There is a lot more to life then just work. I try to put things into perspective this is such a small part of my life that I should think about the things
                        that acutally matter. Not to say that school doesn't matter, but the point is that things like <em>health and well being</em> should be looked after more than just school. Link to canvas <a href="https://canvas.ucsd.edu">here</a><br>
